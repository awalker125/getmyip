getmyip
==================

This application returns your IP address using a REST webservice.

It was written to allow the automation of AWS security groups based on the public IP you are using now. This is useful if you are behind a proxy or have a dynamic IP assigned by and ISP.

It should avoid opening the quad zero 0.0.0.0/0
